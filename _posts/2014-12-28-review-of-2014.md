<p class="meta">28 Dec 2014 - Beijing, China</p>

I read a tweet this morning:
> My goal for 2015 is to accomplish the goals of 2014 which I should have done in 2013 because I made a promise in 2012 & planned in 2011.

That's true. Life changes. And most people cannot control themselves. I think that's why I don't want to make any plans. But we still can review something, it will remind us what have changed in out life. 2014 is an important year for me because of certain things I have done.

First of all, I got married! Our wedding will be held on Feb 8, 2015 in my hometown.

We received the marriage certificate on March 10, 2014. Then we paid a visit to Chengdu, Sichuan for the honeymoon, and also to determine the possibility of settling down there in the future. We visited Mount Qingcheng which is famous for the culture of Taoism and beautiful scenery, and Dujiang Weir, which is known for the Dujiangyan Irrigation Project completed over 2,000 years ago. Of cource, the delicious food is very impressive too!

Second, I went to the U.S. in Spring and Autumn, and have been to LA and Boston.
